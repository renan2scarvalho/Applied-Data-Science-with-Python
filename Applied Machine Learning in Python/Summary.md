## Work: Plot Dynamic Probability Distribution Functions

Interactive Jupyter notebook for the main **probability distribution functions** generated through numpy random generator, with matplotlib and seaborn packs for data visualizatons.
The probability functions are: 
1. Normal
2. Gamma
3. Exponential
4. Uniform
5. Logistic
6. Poisson
7. ChiSquare
8. Student t
9. Binomial
10. Weibull
