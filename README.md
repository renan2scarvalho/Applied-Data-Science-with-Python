# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python

This respository contains similar works as proposed on the University of Michigan "Applied Data Science with Python" Specialization assignments at the end of each Module.

The Specialization was divided into:
1. [Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science%20with%20Python)
2. [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Plotting%2C%20Charting%20%26%20Data%20Representation%20in%20Python)
3. [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Python)
4. [Applied Text Mining in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Text%20Mining%20in%20Python)
