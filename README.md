# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python

This respository contains similar works as proposed on the University of Michigan ["Applied Data Science with Python Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) assignments at the end of each Module.

The Specialization was divided into:
1. [Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science%20with%20Python)
2. [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Plotting%2C%20Charting%20%26%20Data%20Representation%20in%20Python)
3. [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Python)
4. [Applied Text Mining in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Text%20Mining%20in%20Python)
5. [Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](https://github.com/renan2scarvalho/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/master/Applied%20Social%20Network%20Analysis%20in%20Python)
