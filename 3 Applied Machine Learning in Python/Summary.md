## Work: Machine Learning Classification Task to Predict whether a Pregnant Women will make a Cesarian or not

This works aims to predict a Cesarian based on some attributes, presented above. The dataset, which can be found here, is from the UCI repository, and is a classification problem, univariate with 80 instances i.e. samples, and 5 attributes.

Attribute Information:Â¶
Age: [22,26,28,27,32,36,33,23,20,29,25,37,24,18,30,40,31,19,21,35,17,38]
Delivery number: [1,2,3,4]
Delivery time: [0,1,2] -> 0 = timely , 1 = premature , 2 = latecomer
Blood of Pressure: [2,1,0] -> 0 = low , 1 = normal , 2 = high
Heart Problem: [1,0] -> 0 = apt, 1 = inept

Cesarian: [0,1] -> 0 = No, 1 = Yes
